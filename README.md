# m1-Fuzzer
Web-Fuzzer made in python so its not the fastest. If u want a fast one, make one in go lang

Started this during my internship. Can fuzz for subdomains in directories. ITS NOT FULLY FINISHED THERES SO MUCH MORE TO DO!!

Didnt create it for public use, just for me to practice some programming using requests. If you still want to use it, you need to change the wordlists in the py file. I could make a changeable wordlist per command but i dont see the use for it, when im using it on my own and just want to use those wordlists. 

Just a simple code
